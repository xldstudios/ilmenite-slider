Ilmenite Slider
===============

Basic WordPress slider plugin that adds Flexslider. Made to work with custom theme development and therefore contains no direct theme options panel.

You can override the default slider settings, by placing a slider.js file in the *js* directory of your theme which will be loaded instead of the one provided by the plugin.

For documentation on the slider itself, please see Flexslide's page: http://www.woothemes.com/flexslider/
